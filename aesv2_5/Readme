AES Bulk encryptor/decryptor:
	performs only encryption
	
	have 6 interfacing pipes
	e_in_data, e_out_data, d_in_data, d_out_data, cmd_in and status_out
	
Wrapper:
	Used to convert above 6 pipes into 1 input and 1 output pipe
	so that riffa 1 channel communication can be used
	
	The data is communicated in the form of packet (2048 32-bit words)
	having first 4 words as header.
	If new key is needed to provide then the packet size is increased by 4 32-bit words.
