Specification of Bulk-encryption Co-processor.
-----------------------------------------------

  Either encrypt/decrypt a 128-bit block

  Inputs:
	Pipe in_data 64-bits wide.
  Outputs:
	Pipe out_data 64-bits wide.

  Internal registers
	4xKey-register(s)
	

  Behaviour:

	On reset, will wait for command packets.

	command packets
           key-register writes
	   e/d command
		number of blocks to process
		whether to encrypt/decrypt
		the key-register to use.
		encryption/decryption mode.
	   key-register reads.

	In response to command packet, co-processor
	sends a status packet on out_data

	Based on command packet, co-processor waits
	for e/d packets on in_data and writes response
	e/d packets to out_data.


  Pseudo-code of implementation.

   main {
	while(1)
	{
		cmd = getCommand()
		resp = executeCommand()
		sendResponse(resp)
	}
  }

  executeCommand (cmd) {
	if(isRegWrite(cmd))
		writeRegister(cmd)
	else if(isRegRead(cmd))
		resp = readRegister(...)
	else if(isEncrypt(cmd))
		resp = encrypt (...)
	else if(isDecrypt(cmd))
		resp = decrypt (...)

	return resp
   }
