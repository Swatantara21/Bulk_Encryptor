Info: -D option selected: VHDL will have debug assertions..
Info: -O option selected, will try to compress control-path..
Info: -S option selected: bypass stride will be set to 4.
Info: -I option is deprecated.. has no effect.
Info: -v option selected: lots of info will be printed (to stderr, and also dot-files of control-paths if -O option is selected).
Info: -a option selected: will try for minimum overall circuit area.
Info: -C option selected: will generate testbench which connects to foreign link.
Info: -e loopback top-level VHDL entity will have name loopback.unformatted_vhdl
Info: -w loopback will write separate system and testbench VHDL files.
Info: -s ghdl option selected: will generate testbench with VHPI link.
Info: module loopback_daemon set as one of the ever-running top modules. 
   NOTE: loopback_daemon cannot have any input/output arguments.
